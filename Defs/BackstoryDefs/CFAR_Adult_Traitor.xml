		<description>On garrison duty, [PAWN_nameDef] grew bold with petty theft, breaking locks and stripping valuables from civilian homes. Neighbors whispered, and soon entire blocks were missing heirlooms. When command finally noticed, [PAWN_pronoun] took [PAWN_possessive] rifle and armor and deserted before the MPs arrived.</description>

		<description>After ambushes, [PAWN_nameDef] scavenged corpses without distinction, stripping allies and enemies alike of weapons, armor, and credits.

		<defName>CFAR_Deserter5</defName>
		<description>On patrol duty, [PAWN_nameDef] made a habit of threatening civilians with live fire to enforce discipline. One incident escalated, and [PAWN_pronoun] gunned down unarmed villagers in full view of witnesses. Knowing the tribunal was inevitable, [PAWN_pronoun] deserted and vanished into pirate ranks.</description>

	<BackstoryDef ParentName="CFAR_Deserter">
		<defName>CFAR_Deserter6</defName>
		<description>In garrison towns, [PAWN_nameDef] prowled alleys and markets, extorting locals for protection money. Knives at throats, boots at doors — [PAWN_possessive] racket spread fear until even NORD officers caught wind. Faced with certain charges, [PAWN_pronoun] slipped into the night and never came back.</description>

		<defName>CFAR_Deserter7</defName>
		<description>On campaign, [PAWN_nameDef] helped run a black-market stall hidden behind the supply tents. Stolen rations and gear were sold in bulk, shared among a handful of deserters-to-be. Once NORD officers traced the shortages to the ring, [PAWN_pronoun] deserted rather than stand trial.</description>

		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] fell in with a circle of troopers who raided villages during night patrols. They moved as a pack, breaking into homes and dividing spoils before dawn. When one of the victims reported the gang, arrests began — and [PAWN_pronoun] deserted before the noose tightened.</description>

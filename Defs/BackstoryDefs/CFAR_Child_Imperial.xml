		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] was a trooper in the Imperial Navy. [PAWN_pronoun] marched out of training with a shiny armor and sharper ambition. The stars were vast and unknown, but so was [PAWN_possessive] resolve. [PAWN_pronoun] waited for [PAWN_possessive] moment to shine.</description>

		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] was a trooper in the Imperial Navy. [PAWN_pronoun] stepped onto the battlefield with fresh boots and eager eyes. Every order was a lesson, every mission a test. [PAWN_pronoun] wasn’t ready for what came next—but [PAWN_pronoun] would learn fast.</description>

		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] was a trooper in the Imperial Navy. Fresh from bootcamp, [PAWN_pronoun] gripped [PAWN_possessive] pulse rifle a little too tight. The hum of the warship’s engines was louder than [PAWN_possessive] confidence. Every order felt heavy, but [PAWN_pronoun] kept moving forward.</description>

		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] was a trooper in the Imperial Navy. Fresh and eager, [PAWN_pronoun] made mistakes—missed targets, wrong calls. The frontlines didn’t forgive. Either [PAWN_pronoun] learned fast or didn’t learn at all.</description>

[ToDo Agenda - Long Term]
1. Draw actual textures : because placeholder textures suck
2. Issue a balance patch for weapons and armor : are they overpowered? or are they plain garbage?
3. Need to make portable mortar utility : have fun carrying that on you backs lol

[ToDo Agenda - Implants]
1. Full Borg Path - Replaces entire body, kinda like Anomaly ghouls, increases defense and offense capabilities, at cost of mental instability. Just like cyberpunk.
2. Implant Path - Partial and modular enhancements. Less drawback, but less significant changes.
* Important : Hard limitations for incompatible implants.

[TODO Agenda]
1. Draw actual textures : because placeholder textures suck
2. Issue a balance patch for weapons and armor : are they overpowered? or are they plain garbage?
3. Reichswehr raid strat : now, come on. the current bullet hell strat works, but clearly I can do better than that.
4. Need to make portable mortar utility : have fun carrying that on you backs lol
